# Python Algo Trading Practice - Lists_Day4

This folder contains Python problem solutions and exercises related to algorithmic trading, as part of my learning journey inspired by Kuldeep Singh's "100 Days of Hell With Python Algotrading" series.

## About This Folder

- **Purpose:**
  - To practice and implement Python problems focused on data structures (especially lists, tuples, and dictionaries) and their applications in algorithmic trading.
  - To reinforce concepts taught by Kuldeep Singh through hands-on coding.

- **Source of Problems:**
  - Problems are adapted from [Kuldeep Singh's GitHub repository](https://github.com/thekuldeepsingh/100-Days-Of-Hell-With-Python-Algotrading).
  - Video explanations and tutorials are available on his [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUTKklmYVO37Ik8K1Ftdp4ULk3dMBCKYp&si=49NKjj7Mj4KOxDeO).

## Folder Structure

Each Python file in this folder addresses a specific problem or concept, such as:
- List manipulation and comprehension
- Tuple and dictionary operations
- Error handling
- String and data processing
- Algorithmic problem-solving relevant to trading

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Source Repository (Optional):**
   - [Kuldeep Singh's 100 Days of Hell With Python Algotrading](https://github.com/thekuldeepsingh/100-Days-Of-Hell-With-Python-Algotrading)

2. **Watch the Playlist:**

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Each script is standalone and can be run using Python 3.x:
     ```powershell
     python <script_name.py>
     ```
