# Python Algo Trading Practice - Tuples_Day5

This folder contains Python problem solutions and exercises related to tuples and dictionary management, as part of my learning journey inspired by Kuldeep Singh's "100 Days of Hell With Python Algotrading" series.

## About This Folder

- **Purpose:**
  - To practice and implement Python problems focused on tuples, dictionaries, and their applications in algorithmic trading.
  - To reinforce concepts taught by Kuldeep Singh through hands-on coding.

- **Source of Problems:**
  - Problems are adapted from [Kuldeep Singh's GitHub repository](https://github.com/thekuldeepsingh/100-Days-Of-Hell-With-Python-Algotrading).
  - Video explanations and tutorials are available on his [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUTKklmYVO37Ik8K1Ftdp4ULk3dMBCKYp&si=49NKjj7Mj4KOxDeO).

## Folder Structure

Each Python file in this folder addresses a specific problem or concept, such as:
- Tuple operations and manipulations
- Dictionary management and conversion
- Set and tuple differences
- Zipping and unzipping tuples
- Algorithmic problem-solving relevant to trading
