# Python Algo Trading

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and code implementations for algorithmic trading problems and concepts, inspired by Kuldeep Singh's "100 Days of Hell With Python Algotrading" series.

## About This Repository

- **Purpose:**
  - To document my learning journey in Python-based algorithmic trading.
  - To practice and solve coding problems related to data structures, algorithms, and trading strategies.
  - To organize code by topic and day, following the structure of the original course.

- **Learning Source:**
  - Problems and concepts are based on [Kuldeep Singh's GitHub repository](https://github.com/thekuldeepsingh/100-Days-Of-Hell-With-Python-Algotrading).
  - Video tutorials and explanations are available on his [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUTKklmYVO37Ik8K1Ftdp4ULk3dMBCKYp&si=49NKjj7Mj4KOxDeO).

## Repository Structure

- Each subfolder (e.g., `Lists_Day4/`) contains Python scripts for a specific topic or day.
- Scripts are named according to the problem or concept they address.
- Example topics include:
  - List, tuple, and dictionary operations
  - String manipulation
  - Error handling
  - Algorithmic problem-solving for trading

## Getting Started

1. **Clone This Repository:**
   ```powershell
